    <p class="p-description e-content">Scott was born on xmas day. To celebrate him, his wife Jen started a 5k race called “Dem Calves” (I mean have you seen the man’s calves?). This race is a one mile loop run three times from Scott's house. In between each loop Jen thinks up some activity we have to do (ie make Scott a bday poem, eat a powdered donut) before starting the next loop. There is a trophy. This years Dem Calves will be Dec 17 at 8 am. Mark your calendars.</p>
